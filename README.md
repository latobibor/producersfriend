# The songwriter's feedback engine

## The idea and the goal

When you write songs you may want to get expert feedback before you hand them over to the public. Posting it on forums is a subpar solution
for this, since people love to troll, argue with each other, or spam with their own music.

Therefore instead of having an open forum I would like to create a site with strict rules and rewards:
1. You can only submit a song if you have given feedback to 2 other songs (to ensure everybody gets enough feedback)
1. You can comment on many songs you would like in 2 distinct topics: songwriting and mixing
1. The owner of the song can judge your comment as Helpful / Not helpful

A bit like stackoverflow, suited for songwriters.

## The realistic goal

I know that if I would want to make this site work I would have to quit my job and code it 5 times a week, so this project is more like 
teaching myself Angular 4 w/ Typescript and modern CSS without concerns on browser compatibility, scrum of scrum meetings and backlog groomings.

But if you feel this thing is really missing from your life, please feel free to reach out to me.
